          Hello, I'm Saadia, and I have a passion for problem-solving and
          debugging üêû. I discovered my love for programming back in high
          school, where I began creating websites using basic HTML with just a
          simple text editor, like NotePad üòÜ. However, I initially pursued a
          career in hydraulic engineering and worked in the field for a couple
          of years. Eventually, I realised that my heart wasn't in it, and I
          yearned to return to my true passion: programming. Recently, I made
          the decision to switch careers and pursue a path in tech. I'm excited
          to see where this journey takes me!
